# Job Listing UI ðŸŽ¯

This repository contains modifications of the code provided by `Traversy Media` aka (`Brad Traversy`) in his [wonderful React crash course (2024)](https://youtu.be/LDB4uaJ87e0?si=59XgftFHFovZmT_u) tutorial.

The Job Listing UI is a front-end app that uses [`React`](https://react.dev/), [`react-router-dom`](https://reactrouter.com/en/main), [`json-server`](https://github.com/typicode/json-server), and many more Web Technologies.
